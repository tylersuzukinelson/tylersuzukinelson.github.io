## Gameplay

* The object of the game is to score as high a score as possible
* You can increase your score by eating food
* Slithering into a wall will decrease your score, and cause both players to respawn
* Slithering into your tail or the other player will decrease your score, and cause both players to respawn
* If your tail is hit by an asteroid, your tail will be sliced off at that point
* If your head is hit by an asteroid, your score will be decreased, and both players will respawn
